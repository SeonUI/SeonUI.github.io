# Intro

I am student learning about computer science. Timid but courageous, lazy but diligent, that is brief description of my nature. I have a motto, work hard loosely, it is good to have living this busy modern times.

# Skills
I'm just lazy sophomore, it means there are no professinal, or specialised skills. However I can make programs with some languages with at least intermediate level.
- C: I understood and can implement all grammars in C including pointer array, malloc, etc. I've implemented several data structures in C.
- C++: I can use all grammars in C++ including STL, Vectors and so on.
- Java: I understood all grammars, and can implement classes with keeping a rule of OOP. 
- Python: I've implemented simple neural network that makes linear approximation with python. In addition, I've made simple rocket game with pygame library. However, I don't fully aware of grammars of it.

# Educations
I'm a sophomore in SungKyunKwan University, College of Computing and Informatics, with computer science major. I took several courses.

- System Programming
- Data Structure
- Algoritms

- Physics
- Linear Algebra
- Discrete Mathematics
- English (Bad)

# Achievements
I received dean's list award in 2022's spring semester, WOW! However, unfortunately, no other achievements or certifications exists now.
